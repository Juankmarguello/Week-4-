In this part, the hypothesis tests developed under the ANOVA analysis of
variance, can say that there is evidence that in Colombia women and men
there is a great difference in relation to the salary that each one
earns from their jobs, but it can be said that it is in all activities,
such as at work or when studying and working at the same time?

hundred thousand Colombian pesos, although the difference between men is
not great if they earn more than women, and it is the difference that
the test of the regression shows.

== Conclution

When looking at the effect of gender on income, it can be concluded that
there are differences between men and women. On the other hand, when we
look at these effects by economic activity that the person performs home
chores or housewives, they show the dispersion between the salaries of
women compared to men. When looking at work or looking for one, this
difference of being a man or a woman is also visible. But when we look
at the people who study or who carry out other economic activity, there
are no differences between men and women in terms of salary.
